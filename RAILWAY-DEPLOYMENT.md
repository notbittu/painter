# Railway Deployment Checklist

This file outlines the critical files and configurations for Railway deployment.

## Critical Files

- [x] `Dockerfile` - Builds the application using a multi-stage process
- [x] `railway.json` - Railway-specific configuration
- [x] `nginx.conf` - Web server configuration
- [x] `package.json` - Root package configuration with proper scripts
- [x] `.dockerignore` - Excludes unnecessary files from Docker builds
- [x] `.railwayignore` - Excludes unnecessary files from Railway processing

## Configuration Validation

- [x] `railway.json` includes proper health check configuration
- [x] Environment variables properly set in `railway.json`
- [x] Docker multi-stage build process optimized
- [x] Nginx configured with proper worker settings
- [x] Root package.json has proper start/build scripts

## Deployment Process

1. Ensure all changes are committed and pushed to GitHub
2. Railway will automatically detect changes and build/deploy the application
3. Monitor deployment logs for any issues
4. Verify health checks are passing

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails, check:

1. Docker build logs for any errors
2. Railway health check status
3. Nginx configuration
4. Environment variables

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are configured:

- `NODE_ENV`: Set to "production"
- `PORT`: Set to "80"
- `RAILWAY_STATIC_URL`: URL for the application
- `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`: API base URL
